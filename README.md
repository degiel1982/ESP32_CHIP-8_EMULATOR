# CHIP-8 Emulator User Manual

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive implementation of a CHIP-8 emulator, a simplistic interpreted programming language originally developed in the 1970s for video game creation. The emulator facilitates the execution of CHIP-8 programs on a modern microcontroller-based platform, featuring an OLED display and keypad for user interaction. The CHIP-8 was originally designed to be used with a simplified system, but the current implementation allows enthusiasts to relive this experience using modern technology. This project is particularly significant for those interested in retrocomputing, embedded systems, and software emulation, as it showcases a practical application of both low-level hardware control and software emulation techniques.

The emulator's design reflects a deep understanding of both the hardware and software aspects involved in making legacy systems operational on current technology. This approach requires knowledge of microcontroller programming, user interface management, display rendering, and the challenges associated with adapting legacy software for modern environments. Thus, the project not only serves as an emulation tool but also as a learning platform for those looking to enhance their expertise in embedded systems and emulator design.

## Project Components
The project is composed of several interconnected components, each of which plays a pivotal role in emulation. These include the CHIP-8 interpreter, input management, display management, and auxiliary utility functions. Below is an in-depth analysis of the core components:

### CHIP-8 Core Functionality (chip8.h, chip8_core.cpp, chip8_core.h)
The core files encapsulate the fundamental logic of the CHIP-8 emulator, managing opcodes, registers, memory, timers, and the graphics buffer. These functions interpret and execute the 35 opcodes of the CHIP-8, which facilitate arithmetic operations, memory manipulation, graphics rendering, and control flow. The `chip8_core` class emulates the CPU, manages memory allocation, and maintains state for graphics and audio operations. This level of emulation involves accurately reproducing the behavior of an 8-bit CPU, simulating register operations, stack management, and input/output control, which are all pivotal to executing CHIP-8 games correctly.

The opcode interpreter in the core files has been designed to handle both common and unique instructions from the CHIP-8 instruction set. The proper handling of each opcode ensures that the behavior of original CHIP-8 applications is faithfully reproduced. This is particularly challenging due to the need to adapt timing and memory management for the hardware differences between a 1970s system and a modern microcontroller. The use of timers within the emulator mimics the delay and sound timers originally present in CHIP-8, providing a realistic experience for users.

### Emulator Main File (chip8_emulator.ino)
The primary `.ino` file integrates all components to form a cohesive emulation environment. It contains essential setup and looping functions tailored to the Arduino-style execution model. This file ensures continuous updates to the CHIP-8 processor and manages user input as well as display refresh cycles, effectively orchestrating the overall system. The setup function initializes peripherals, including the OLED display and keypad, while the loop function ensures that each component is updated in synchronization.

The `.ino` file plays a key role in maintaining the overall timing of the system, ensuring that the emulator runs smoothly at a rate consistent with the original CHIP-8 specifications. This includes managing frame rates for display updates and capturing input events in real time. By leveraging Arduino’s simple programming model, the main file abstracts many complex interactions, making the system easier to extend or modify for different types of hardware or new features.

### Flag Management (flag_manager.h)
The `flag_manager.h` file maintains system state through various flags, including those for graphics updates and other operational states. It plays a critical role in synchronizing different components of the emulator by ensuring screen updates occur only when necessary, thereby optimizing performance. The flag system allows the emulator to minimize unnecessary operations, which is essential for preserving CPU cycles and ensuring a responsive user interface.

Flags are also used to synchronize the input and output states, ensuring that graphical changes are displayed only after processing all relevant input. This synchronization prevents visual artifacts and ensures consistency between what the user does on the keypad and what is shown on the screen. Effective flag management also makes the emulator more power-efficient, which is particularly important for embedded applications running on battery-powered devices.

### Input Management (gpio_keypad.h)
The `gpio_keypad.h` file is responsible for handling input from a 16-button keypad, which emulates the original CHIP-8 keys. It facilitates user interaction by mapping the physical keypad inputs to CHIP-8 key values, while also implementing debouncing logic to ensure stable input capture. Debouncing is crucial in embedded systems as physical switches tend to produce noise when pressed, and without debouncing, this noise could result in erratic or unintended input behavior.

The keypad handler not only translates user actions into the correct CHIP-8 key values but also manages the overall responsiveness of the system. It employs state machine techniques to keep track of key presses, ensuring that each press is correctly registered and that no multiple key presses are missed. This robustness is essential for accurately playing games that may require rapid input.

### Display Management (ssd1306oled.h)
The `ssd1306oled.h` file manages the OLED display, which is driven by the Adafruit SSD1306 library. It is tasked with rendering the graphical output of the CHIP-8 emulator. This file contains functions for updating the graphics buffer on the OLED display, ensuring that visual changes are accurately depicted according to the flags set by the core CHIP-8 processor. The display output must replicate the 64x32-pixel resolution of the original CHIP-8 system, which is achieved through careful scaling and pixel management.

The OLED management also handles the dual challenge of low-resolution graphics and ensuring sufficient contrast and brightness. Since the CHIP-8 graphics are monochrome, effective display management involves ensuring that the limited visual elements are rendered clearly on the modern OLED hardware. The file’s implementation takes advantage of the display’s capabilities to accurately draw pixels, which is fundamental for maintaining the nostalgic look and feel of CHIP-8 games.

### ROM Loading (roms.h)
The `roms.h` file comprises pre-loaded CHIP-8 programs in hexadecimal format, representing classic CHIP-8 games or test applications. The emulator loads these ROMs into memory, allowing immediate user interaction with pre-existing software. ROMs are represented as arrays of bytes, and each ROM is loaded sequentially into the CHIP-8’s addressable memory, beginning at a specific memory offset.

This component also provides the flexibility to add additional programs. By expanding the ROM definitions, users can include more games or applications, demonstrating the versatility of the emulator. The design of the ROM loader ensures that different programs can be seamlessly switched, providing a smooth user experience when experimenting with various CHIP-8 applications.

## How It Works
- **Initialization:** Initialization occurs in the main `.ino` file, where the OLED display and keypad are configured. During this phase, the necessary hardware peripherals are initialized, and the initial memory state is set up, which includes loading the selected ROM into memory.
- **Instruction Execution:** The CHIP-8 core begins executing the loaded ROM by fetching, decoding, and executing instructions in a continuous cycle, similar to a traditional CPU. The fetch-decode-execute cycle is central to the emulator's operation, ensuring that each instruction is handled correctly and in the proper sequence.
- **User Input Handling:** User input is captured via the keypad and used to modify the state of the emulator in real time. The emulator interprets key presses, allowing the player to control gameplay or interact with programs. Each key press directly impacts the CPU state, influencing which instructions are executed next.
- **Graphics Rendering:** The graphics are rendered on the OLED display, with updates occurring only when required to conserve processing power. The graphics buffer is drawn to the display when the CHIP-8 core signals that a draw operation is needed, ensuring that the emulator’s visual output remains synchronized with internal state changes.
- **Synchronization:** Flag-based synchronization ensures the emulator components operate harmoniously, mitigating issues such as flickering or lag. This synchronization is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the user experience, ensuring that the emulator responds predictably to both input and the timing requirements of the original CHIP-8 system.

## Usage
- **Setup:** Upload the code to a compatible microcontroller (e.g., an Arduino with sufficient memory). Connect an SSD1306 OLED display and a 16-button keypad according to the hardware specifications detailed in the code. This step involves ensuring that all hardware connections are correct, including I2C for the OLED and GPIO pins for the keypad.
- **Loading ROMs:** The emulator includes pre-loaded ROMs in the `roms.h` file. To switch games, modify the ROM selection in the main `.ino` file. This involves changing which ROM is loaded at startup, allowing users to try different games or applications as needed.
- **Playing Games:** The keypad enables user interaction with the game, with button mappings consistent with the original CHIP-8 keypad. Specific instructions for gameplay are embedded within each ROM. Players can use the keypad to control characters, navigate menus, and execute game-specific actions, making the experience similar to the original.
